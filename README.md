# HighlightImpreciseItalicAngle.glyphsReporter

A plugin for the [Glyphs font editor](http://glyphsapp.com/).

Highlights the path segments which angle is not precise to master's Italic Angle and is within observed angle range (±10 degrees around Italic Angle). Also it adds dots around the nodes to indicate the horizontal direction of node movement for angle correction.

- Red color means that the segment most likely needs correction.
- Yellow color means that the segment angle is almost precise (±0.5 degree) so you can just leave it as is.
