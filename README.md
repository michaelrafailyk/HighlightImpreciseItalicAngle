# HighlightImpreciseItalicAngle.glyphsReporter

A plugin for the [Glyphs font editor](http://glyphsapp.com/).

Highlights the path segments which angle is not precise to master's Italic Angle and is within observed angle range (+10 and -10 degrees around Italic Angle). Also it adds dots around the nodes to indicate the horizontal direction of node movement for angle correction.
